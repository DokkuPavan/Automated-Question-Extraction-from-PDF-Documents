# Automated-Question-Extraction-from-PDF-Documents
This project automates the extraction of questions from PDF documents using text processing and NLP techniques. It involves parsing PDFs, identifying question patterns, and organizing them into a structured format. Technologies used include Python, PyPDF2/PDFPlumber, and NLP libraries like SpaCy and NLTK.

# PDF Question Extraction Project

This project automates the extraction of questions from PDF documents using text processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system scans PDF files, identifies question patterns, and extracts them for further use.

## Key Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts readable text from PDF files.
- **Question Detection**: Identifies and extracts questions from the text using NLP.
- **Data Formatting**: Organizes extracted questions into a structured format.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **PyPDF2 / PDFPlumber**: Libraries for PDF text extraction.
- **NLP (SpaCy / NLTK)**: Used to process text and detect question patterns.
- **Regular Expressions**: For detecting common question structures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-question-extraction.git
